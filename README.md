This is a well-organized dashboard showing various aspects of superstore sales performance, including

sales by category

top profitable products
monthly sales trends
sales by segment
effect of shipping modes

Here’s an analysis of each section :

1. Sales Per Category
Analysis:
Technology and Furniture categories (especially Phones, Copiers, and Chairs) show high sales, whereas Office Supplies like Labels and Envelopes have lower sales.

Consider increasing marketing efforts for lower-selling categories like Office Supplies, or offering bundled discounts to boost their sales.
Additionally, analyze if high-selling categories need inventory adjustments.

2. Impact of Discount on Profit & Sales
Analysis:
The graph suggests that as discount percentages increase, both profit and sales drop significantly after a certain point.

Determine the optimal discount rate that maximizes sales without severely impacting profit.
Avoid high discounts unless it’s a clearance sale to clear excess stock.

3. Top 10 Profitable Products
Analysis:
Some products, such as high-end items like routers and phones, generate more profit. However, there is a noticeable difference between the sum of sales and profit across products.

Prioritize stocking profitable items with high sales, like smart phones and routers, and consider focusing on marketing for these items.
Additionally, evaluate the margin of less profitable but high-sales products to see if minor pricing adjustments could improve profitability.

4. Sales by Month in Each Year
Analysis:
Sales trends show significant fluctuations across months and years, with noticeable peaks in certain months.

Investigate the months with high sales to see if they correlate with specific seasonal demand, promotions, or events.
Planning marketing campaigns around these peak months could further increase sales.

5. Sales by Segment
Analysis:
The Consumer segment contributes the most to sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office.

To balance the contribution, consider targeted marketing strategies for the Corporate and Home Office segments, perhaps with bulk purchase discounts or loyalty programs.

6. Effect of Shipping Mode
Analysis:
Standard Class shipping dominates sales volume, but Same Day shipping has the highest cost.

Encourage customers to use cost-effective shipping options like Second Class by offering discounts or incentives, especially for lower-margin products.
This could help reduce shipping costs while maintaining customer satisfaction.
